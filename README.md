# Audio-denoising---SDR
An software defined radio (SDR) toolkit to remove noise from audio source.

A mini Python project for audio denoising, it uses the concept of multi rate signal processing and wavelet transform theory to remove noise from an audio source, the imported .wav (audio with noise) is denoised using this code. A simple concept of upsampling, downsampling and filter analysis is used to remove the noise from the input audio.
